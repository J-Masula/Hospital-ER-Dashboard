📌 Overview

This project analyzes Emergency Room (ER) operations using Power BI to uncover patterns in patient flow, wait times, referrals, and demographics.
The dashboard is designed to support data-driven decision-making aimed at improving operational efficiency and patient experience.


🎯 Business Questions Addressed

- Are patients being attended to within acceptable wait times?
- Which departments receive the highest ER referrals?
- When do peak patient volumes occur (day/hour)?
- How do demographics impact ER utilization?
- Where are the operational bottlenecks affecting patient satisfaction?
